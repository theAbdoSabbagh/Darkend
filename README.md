# Disclaimers
1. Here at Darkend we do **not** believe in manually editing the configuration files of the accounts.
    - If you face any issue/bug after manually editing the files, you will **not** be assisted.
<br></br>
2. While Darkend is safe, it is still a use-on-your-own-risk application.
    - No account was disabled while using Darkend, but **nothing** can be 100% safe.
<br></br>
3. Shifts are not added **yet**.
    - I advice you autofarm for less than 5 hours before taking a break for a few hours so you don't get banned.
